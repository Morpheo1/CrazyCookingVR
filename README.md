# Course Project

This is a project that was made during the Virtual Reality course at EPFL. 
This was a group project where I was the one who did all of the C# scripts.

# Crazy Cooking VR

This is a VR video-game where the goal is to cook meals as fast as possible. It is therefore centered around gameplay and speed, with interactions such as throwing and attracting objects that feel fun to do.
